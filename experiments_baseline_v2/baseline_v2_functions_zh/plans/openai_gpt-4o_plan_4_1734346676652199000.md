        "content": "To create a smart home application based on your functional description, we'll develop a Python script that utilizes the provided source code files. The script will implement the functionalities for each of the specified plans: \"Morning Plan\", \"Leave Home Plan\", and \"Movie Plan\". Let's address each plan in detail:\n\n1. **Morning Plan:** Involves controlling the curtains.\n2. **Leave Home Plan:** Involves controlling the lights.\n3. **Movie Plan:** Involves adjusting the light brightness.\n\nWe will create a script called `smart_home.py` to implement these plans. Below is the code for this script:\n\n### `smart_home.py`\n\n```python\nfrom home.home_plan import home_plan, get_all_actuators\n\ndef morning_plan(home):\n    print(\"\\nExecuting Morning Plan...\")\n    curtains = get_all_actuators(home, \"Curtain\")\n    for curtain in curtains:\n        curtain.turn_on()  # Open the curtains\n        curtain.turn_off()  # Close the curtains\n\ndef leave_home_plan(home):\n    print(\"\\nExecuting Leave Home Plan...\")\n    lights = get_all_actuators(home, \"Light\")\n    for light in lights:\n        light.turn_off()  # Turn off all the lights\n\ndef movie_plan(home):\n    print(\"\\nExecuting Movie Plan...\")\n    lights = get_all_actuators(home, \"Light\")\n    for light in lights:\n        light.turn_on()  # Ensure the light is on\n        light.set_brightness_level(\"low\")  # Set the light to a low brightness level for movie ambiance\n\ndef main():\n    home = home_plan()\n    morning_plan(home)\n    leave_home_plan(home)\n    movie_plan(home)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Execution Instructions\n\nTo run the smart home application in a Linux terminal, follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that you have a directory named `home` containing the provided Python files (`sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, `config.py`) and the `logger_config.py` file (which is assumed to be part of your setup).\n\n2. Place the `smart_home.py` script in the same directory as the `home` folder.\n\n3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `smart_home.py`.\n\n4. Execute the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 smart_home.py\n   ```\n\nThis will run the smart home application and execute each plan in sequence. The script leverages the existing classes and methods to control the devices according to the specified plans.",
