        "content": "To create a smart home application based on the provided functional description and source code, we need to define how each \"plan\" is implemented using the actuators and sensors from the provided modules. Here is the implementation in Python, assuming the goal is to manage smart home activities such as making coffee, turning off lights, and adjusting curtains for watching a movie.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe'll create a new script named `smart_home.py` to implement the desired functionality.\n\n```python\n# smart_home.py\nfrom home.home_plan import home_plan, get_all_actuators\nfrom home.actuator import CoffeeMachine, Light, Curtain\n\ndef morning_plan(home):\n    # Find and turn on the Coffee Machine in the Kitchen\n    coffee_machines = get_all_actuators(home, \"CoffeeMachine\")\n    for coffee_machine in coffee_machines:\n        if coffee_machine.room_name == \"Kitchen\":\n            coffee_machine.turn_on()\n            coffee_machine.make_coffee(\"Espresso\")  # or any type of coffee you want\n            break\n\ndef leave_home_plan(home):\n    # Turn off all lights\n    lights = get_all_actuators(home, \"Light\")\n    for light in lights:\n        light.turn_off()\n\ndef movie_plan(home):\n    # Turn on the TV and draw curtains in the Living Room\n    curtains = get_all_actuators(home, \"Curtain\")\n    for curtain in curtains:\n        if curtain.room_name == \"LivingRoom\":\n            curtain.turn_on()  # Assuming turning on closes the curtains\n            break\n\n    # Optionally, you might want to turn on the Smart TV here\n    # tvs = get_all_actuators(home, \"SmartTV\")\n    # for tv in tvs:\n    #     if tv.room_name == \"LivingRoom\":\n    #         tv.turn_on()\n    #         tv.play_channel(\"Movie Channel\")  # or any channel you want\n    #         break\n\ndef main():\n    home = home_plan()  # Create the home layout and components\n    print(\"Select a plan to execute:\")\n    print(\"1. Morning Plan\")\n    print(\"2. Leave Home Plan\")\n    print(\"3. Movie Plan\")\n    \n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3): \").strip()\n    \n    if choice == \"1\":\n        morning_plan(home)\n    elif choice == \"2\":\n        leave_home_plan(home)\n    elif choice == \"3\":\n        movie_plan(home)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please select a valid plan.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Running the Application\n\nTo run this application in a Linux terminal, save the above code in a file named `smart_home.py`. Then, execute the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\npython3 smart_home.py\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`morning_plan`**: This function finds the Coffee Machine in the Kitchen, turns it on, and makes coffee.\n\n2. **`leave_home_plan`**: This function turns off all the lights in the house.\n\n3. **`movie_plan`**: This function turns on the curtains in the Living Room to simulate drawing them for a movie.\n\n4. **`main`**: The main function initializes the home environment and prompts the user to select which plan to execute.\n\nThis setup should work with the provided code files (`sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`) that define the necessary components and interactions within the smart home.",
