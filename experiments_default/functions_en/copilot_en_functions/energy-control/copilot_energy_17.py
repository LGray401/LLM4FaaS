# Based on the content of the markdown file, you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` that should be located in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The markdown file also provides the functional description of the project, which is to save energy. However, the specific requirements or functionalities that should be implemented in the `function.py` file to achieve this goal are not provided.
#
# The markdown file also includes the source code of four Python files (`sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`) that are part of your project. These files define various classes for sensors and actuators in a smart home, a home plan that sets up rooms with these sensors and actuators, and some configuration constants.
#
# To proceed, you would need to provide more specific requirements for the `function.py` file. For example, how should it interact with the sensors and actuators to save energy? Should it turn off certain actuators when they're not needed, or adjust the settings of some actuators based on the readings from certain sensors? Once these details are provided, a more specific code can be written for the `function.py` file.
