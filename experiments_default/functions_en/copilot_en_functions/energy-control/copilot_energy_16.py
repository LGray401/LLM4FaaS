# Based on the content of the markdown file, you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` that should be located in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The markdown file also provides the functional description of your project, which is "Energy saving". However, it does not provide specific details about what this function should do in terms of energy saving.
#
# The markdown file also provides the source code for four Python files in your project: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files are located in the 'home' folder.
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and smoke sensors. Each sensor can be turned on or off, and can provide readings when it is on.
#
# The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators, such as heaters, AC units, coffee machines, windows, doors, curtains, cleaning robots, notification senders, music players, lights, smart TVs, smart sockets, and humidifiers. Each actuator can be turned on or off, and some of them have additional functions.
#
# The `home_plan.py` file contains a class for rooms, which can contain sensors and actuators. It also contains functions to create rooms with components, print the home plan, and get information about rooms, sensors, and actuators.
#
# The `config.py` file contains configuration values for your project, such as temperature and humidity thresholds, light intensity levels, and durations for certain actions.
#
# Without more specific details about what the main function in `function.py` should do, it's hard to provide a more specific answer. However, based on the provided information, it seems like the main function might need to control the sensors and actuators in each room to achieve energy saving. For example, it could turn off lights when the light intensity is high, or turn off heaters or AC units when the temperature is within a certain range.
