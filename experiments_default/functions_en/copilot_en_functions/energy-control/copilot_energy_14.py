# Based on the content of the markdown file, you are working on a smart home project and you need a `function.py` file. This file should be located in the 'functions' folder and should contain the main function.
#
# The project consists of four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`, which are located in the 'home' folder.
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and smoke sensors.
#
# The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators, such as heaters, ACs, coffee machines, windows, doors, curtains, cleaning robots, notification senders, music players, lights, smart TVs, smart sockets, and humidifiers.
#
# The `home_plan.py` file contains classes for creating rooms and adding sensors and actuators to them.
#
# The `config.py` file contains configuration settings such as temperature and humidity thresholds, light intensity levels, and wait durations.
#
# The functional description provided is "Xiaog launches the Earth Environmental Protection Plan". However, the markdown file does not provide specific details about what this function should do. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific `function.py` file without more information.
#
# Please provide more details about the functionality you want to implement in the `function.py` file.
