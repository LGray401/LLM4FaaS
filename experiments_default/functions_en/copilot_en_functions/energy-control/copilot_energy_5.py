# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a `function.py` file. This file should be located in the 'functions' folder and should contain the main function.
#
# The markdown file also provides the source code for four Python files (`sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`) that are part of your project. These files are located in the 'home' folder.
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors that can be used in a smart home, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and smoke sensors.
#
# The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators that can be used in a smart home, such as heaters, air conditioners, coffee machines, windows, doors, curtains, cleaning robots, notification senders, music players, lights, smart TVs, smart sockets, and humidifiers.
#
# The `home_plan.py` file contains classes for creating rooms in the smart home and adding sensors and actuators to these rooms.
#
# The `config.py` file contains configuration settings for the smart home, such as temperature and humidity thresholds and wait durations.
#
# However, the markdown file does not provide a functional description for the `function.py` file or specify what the main function in this file should do. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific code suggestion for the `function.py` file at this time.
