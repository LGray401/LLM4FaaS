# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# However, the functional description for this new file is not provided in the markdown file. The markdown file only contains the source code for `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py` files.
#
# Without the functional description or specific requirements for the `function.py` file, it's challenging to provide a precise code. Could you please provide more details about what the `function.py` file should do?
