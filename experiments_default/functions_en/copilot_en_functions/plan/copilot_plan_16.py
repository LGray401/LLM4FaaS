# Based on the content of the markdown file, you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The markdown file also provides a functional description for three plans: MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN. However, the details of these plans are not provided, as each plan only mentions 'lamp'.
#
# The markdown file also includes the source code for four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files are located in the 'home' folder of your project.
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and smoke sensors. The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators, such as heaters, ACs, coffee machines, lights, and smart TVs. The `home_plan.py` file contains classes for creating rooms and adding sensors and actuators to them. The `config.py` file contains configuration settings for your project.
#
# Without more specific details about what the main function in `function.py` should do, it's difficult to provide a more detailed answer. However, based on the provided information, the main function might need to create a home plan, add sensors and actuators to the rooms, and implement the MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN.
