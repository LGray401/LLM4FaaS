# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The markdown file also contains the functional description for your project, but it seems to be incomplete as the descriptions for the MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN are not provided.
#
# The markdown file also contains the source code for four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files are located in the 'home' folder.
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors like IndoorTemperatureSensor, OutdoorTemperatureSensor, HumiditySensor, LightIntensiveSensor, and SmokeSensor.
#
# The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators like Heater, AC, CoffeeMachine, Window, Door, Curtain, CleaningRobot, NotificationSender, MusicPlayer, Light, SmartTV, SmartSocket, and Humidifier.
#
# The `home_plan.py` file contains classes for creating a room with components and a home plan with different rooms and their components.
#
# The `config.py` file contains configuration settings for your smart home project.
#
# However, without the functional descriptions and specific requirements for the `function.py` file, it's challenging to provide a more detailed answer or code suggestion.
