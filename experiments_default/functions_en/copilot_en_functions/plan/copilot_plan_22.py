# Based on the provided markdown file, you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` that should be located in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function that implements the following plans:
#
# 1. MORNING PLAN: Turn on the bedroom light, open the curtains, set the music player for 6am, and start the coffee machine to make coffee.
# 2. LEAVE HOME PLAN: Turn off all lights in the house, lock the front door, and close the sockets.
# 3. MOVIE PLAN: Close the curtains, dim the lights, turn on the TV and set the program.
#
# The `function.py` file should interact with the existing Python files (`sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`) in your project.
#
# Here is a high-level pseudocode of what the `function.py` file could look like:
#
# 1. Import necessary modules and classes from `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`.
# 2. Define the `morning_plan`, `leave_home_plan`, and `movie_plan` functions.
# 3. In the `morning_plan` function, turn on the bedroom light, open the curtains, set the music player for 6am, and start the coffee machine.
# 4. In the `leave_home_plan` function, turn off all lights in the house, lock the front door, and close the sockets.
# 5. In the `movie_plan` function, close the curtains, dim the lights, turn on the TV and set the program.
# 6. Define the `main` function that calls the `morning_plan`, `leave_home_plan`, and `movie_plan` functions based on the user's choice.
#
# Please note that the actual implementation of the `function.py` file will depend on the specific methods available in your `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py` files.
