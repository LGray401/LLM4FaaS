# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The markdown file also provides a functional description for three plans: MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN. However, it does not provide specific details about what each plan should do.
#
# The markdown file also includes the source code for four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files define various classes for sensors and actuators in a smart home, a plan for the home, and some configuration settings.
#
# To create the `function.py` file, you would need to define what actions should be taken for each of the three plans based on the state of the sensors and actuators in the home. For example, the MORNING PLAN might involve turning on lights, starting the coffee machine, and adjusting the temperature. The specific actions would depend on the requirements of your project.
