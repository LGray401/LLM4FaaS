# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The functional description provided in the markdown file suggests that you need to implement three plans: MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN. Each plan seems to be associated with a specific actuator in your smart home system:
#
# - MORNING PLAN: curtain
# - LEAVE HOME PLAN: lamp
# - MOVIE PLAN: Adjust light brightness
#
# The source code provided includes implementations for various sensors and actuators in your smart home system, as well as a home plan that defines the rooms in your home and their associated sensors and actuators.
#
# Based on this information, the `function.py` file could define a main function that implements the three plans. For example, the MORNING PLAN could involve opening the curtains, the LEAVE HOME PLAN could involve turning off the lamp, and the MOVIE PLAN could involve adjusting the light brightness.
#
# Here is a pseudocode outline of what the `function.py` file could look like:
#
# ```python
# Import necessary modules and classes

def main():
# Create home plan

# MORNING PLAN:
# Find the Curtain actuator in the home plan
# Call the turn_on method of the Curtain actuator

# LEAVE HOME PLAN:
# Find the Light actuator in the home plan
# Call the turn_off method of the Light actuator

# MOVIE PLAN:
# Find the Light actuator in the home plan
# Call the set_brightness_level method of the Light actuator with the desired brightness level

# Call the main function
# ```
#
# Please note that the actual implementation of the `function.py` file would depend on the specific methods available for each actuator class, as well as how the home plan is structured.
