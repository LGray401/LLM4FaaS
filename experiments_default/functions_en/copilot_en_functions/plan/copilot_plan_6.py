# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` that should be located in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The markdown file also provides a functional description of your project, which includes three plans: MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN. However, the specific actions or tasks for these plans are not detailed in the markdown file.
#
# The markdown file also includes the source code for four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files contain various classes and functions that seem to be related to the operation of a smart home system, such as sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, light intensity), actuators (e.g., heater, AC, coffee machine, light), and a home plan that defines the rooms and their components.
#
# To create the `function.py` file, you would need to define the main function that utilizes these classes and functions to implement the MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN. However, without specific details on what these plans entail, it's challenging to provide a more concrete code suggestion.
