# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a `function.py` file. This file should be located in the 'functions' folder and should contain the main function.
#
# The functional description provided indicates that the temperature should be 26, humidity should be 40, and light intensity should be 80.
#
# The source code provided includes four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files are located in the 'home' folder.
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity sensors. Each sensor has methods to turn on/off, get readings, and get status.
#
# The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators, such as heaters, ACs, lights, and windows. Each actuator has methods to turn on/off and get status. Some actuators have additional methods, like setting target temperature for heaters and ACs.
#
# The `home_plan.py` file contains classes for creating rooms with different sensors and actuators.
#
# The `config.py` file contains configuration settings for the smart home, such as temperature and humidity thresholds.
#
# To create the `function.py` file, you would need to define the main function that uses the classes and methods from these files to control the smart home based on the functional description. For example, the main function could create rooms with the necessary sensors and actuators, set the target temperature and humidity using the values from the functional description, and adjust the light intensity as needed.
