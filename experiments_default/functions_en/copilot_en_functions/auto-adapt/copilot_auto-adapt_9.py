# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a `function.py` file. This file should be located in the 'functions' folder and should contain the main function.
#
# The functional description provided indicates that you need to handle temperature, humidity, and light intensity data.
#
# The source code provided includes Python scripts for sensors (`sensor.py`), actuators (`actuator.py`), a home plan (`home_plan.py`), and configuration settings (`config.py`).
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors, including temperature, humidity, and light intensity sensors. Each sensor can be turned on or off, and can generate readings.
#
# The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators, including heaters, AC units, lights, and more. Each actuator can be turned on or off, and some have additional functions like setting target temperatures or brightness levels.
#
# The `home_plan.py` file contains a class for a Room, which can contain multiple sensors and actuators. It also contains functions to create a room with components, print the home plan, and get information about rooms, sensors, and actuators.
#
# The `config.py` file contains configuration settings for temperature, humidity, and light intensity thresholds, as well as durations for certain actions.
#
# Based on this information, the `function.py` file you need to create will likely need to interact with these sensors and actuators, possibly using the home plan and configuration settings. However, without more specific details about what the main function in `function.py` should do, it's difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
