# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a `function.py` file. This file should be located in the 'functions' folder and should contain the main function.
#
# The functional description and the source code for `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py` are provided. However, the specific functionality that you want to implement in `function.py` is not clearly stated in the markdown file.
#
# Could you please provide more details about the functionality you want to implement in `function.py`? This will help in providing a more accurate code suggestion.
