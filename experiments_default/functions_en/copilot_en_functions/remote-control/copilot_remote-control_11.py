# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a `function.py` file. This file should contain the main function and be located in the 'functions' folder.
#
# The functional description provided includes the following modes: Sleep mode, Wake up mode, Lights off mode, and Window closing mode. However, the specific requirements or behaviors for these modes are not provided in the markdown file.
#
# The markdown file also includes the source code for four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files define various classes and functions related to sensors and actuators in a smart home, the layout of the home, and some configuration constants.
#
# To proceed, we would need more specific details about what the main function in `function.py` should do, particularly in relation to the four modes mentioned in the functional description. For example, what should happen in each mode? Which sensors and actuators should be involved, and how should they behave? Without this information, it's not possible to provide a more specific answer.
