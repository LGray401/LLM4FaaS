# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named 'function.py' to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# However, the functional description and the source code for the remaining two files, 'home_plan.py' and 'config.py', are not provided in the markdown file. Therefore, I am unable to provide a complete answer or generate the 'function.py' file without this information.
#
# Please provide the functional description and the remaining source code so that I can assist you further.
