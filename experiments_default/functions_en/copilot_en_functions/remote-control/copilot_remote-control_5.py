# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a 'function.py' file. However, the functional description and the specific requirements for the 'function.py' file are not provided in the markdown file.
#
# The markdown file does provide the source code for four Python files: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files seem to be part of a smart home system, with various sensors and actuators defined for different rooms in a home.
#
# Without a specific functional description or requirements for the 'function.py' file, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. Could you please provide more details about what you want to achieve with the 'function.py' file?
