# Based on the content of the markdown file, you are working on a smart home project and you need a `function.py` file. This file should be located in the 'functions' folder and should contain the main function. The main function should establish a network control system for your smart home, with separate systems for each room, sensors, and smart devices.
#
# The `function.py` file should interact with the four existing Python files in your project: `sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`. These files are located in the 'home' folder.
#
# The `sensor.py` file contains classes for different types of sensors, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and smoke sensors. The `actuator.py` file contains classes for different types of actuators, such as heaters, ACs, coffee machines, windows, doors, curtains, cleaning robots, notification senders, music players, lights, smart TVs, smart sockets, and humidifiers. The `home_plan.py` file contains a class for rooms and functions for creating rooms with components, getting room sensors and actuators, and getting all sensors and actuators of a certain type. The `config.py` file contains configuration settings for your smart home.
#
# The `function.py` file should use these existing classes and functions to establish the network control system for your smart home. It should create a system for each room, with separate systems for sensors and smart devices. It should also set up parallel branches in the sensor, temperature, humidity, and light intensity, and set up parallel branches in the smart devices.
