# This is a Python code that appears to be part of a home automation system. The code defines classes and functions for managing rooms, sensors, and actuators in a home. Here's a summary:
# 
# **Classes:**
# 
# 1. `Room`: Represents a room in the home, with attributes for name, sensors, and actuators.
# 2. `Sensor` and `Actuator`: Base classes for different types of sensors (e.g., LightIntensiveSensor) and actuators (e.g., Light).
# 3. Specific sensor and actuator classes are defined (e.g., IndoorTemperatureSensor, AC).
# 
# **Functions:**
# 
# 1. `create_room_with_components`: Creates a room with specified sensors and actuators.
# 2. `home_plan`: Defines the home's rooms, sensors, and actuators.
# 3. `print_home_plan`: Prints the home's plan, including room information.
# 4. `get_room`, `get_room_sensors`, `get_room_actuators`: Functions to retrieve specific rooms, sensors, or actuators by name.
# 5. `get_all_sensors` and `get_all_actuators`: Functions to retrieve all sensors or actuators of a specific type.
# 
# **Config File:**
# 
# The code includes a separate file named `config.py` that defines constants for temperature thresholds, humidity ranges, light intensity values, and daily routine duration.
# 
# This code seems well-structured, with clear separation of concerns between the room management logic and the sensor/actuator classes. However, without further context or explanation, it's difficult to provide a more detailed review or suggestions for improvement. If you have specific questions or would like me to review any particular aspect of this code, please let me know!
