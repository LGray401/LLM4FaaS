# Based on the functional description and the provided Python source code, it seems you are working on a smart home project. However, the functional description is not clear as it is written in Chinese and says "Artificial intelligence is quite good" which doesn't provide specific requirements for the 'function.py' file.
#
# To proceed, we need a clear and detailed functional description in English. This should specify what the 'function.py' file should do in the context of your smart home project. For example, it could describe how the different sensors and actuators should interact, what conditions should trigger certain actions, etc.
#
# Once we have this information, we can start creating the 'function.py' file. This file will likely import the necessary classes from your 'sensor.py' and 'actuator.py' files and define a main function that orchestrates the behavior of your smart home based on the provided functional description.
