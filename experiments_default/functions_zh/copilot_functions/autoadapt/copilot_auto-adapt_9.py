# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The functional description provided in the markdown file is in Chinese and translates to:
#
# - Temperature: 26 degrees today
# - Humidity: 45% today
# - Light Intensity: 75 today
#
# The markdown file also includes the source code for four Python files (`sensor.py`, `actuator.py`, `home_plan.py`, and `config.py`) that are part of your project and located in the 'home' folder.
#
# To create the `function.py` file, we need to understand the specific functionality you want to implement. However, the markdown file does not provide clear instructions on what the main function in `function.py` should do.
#
# Could you please provide more details about the functionality you want to implement in `function.py`? This will help in providing a more accurate code suggestion.
