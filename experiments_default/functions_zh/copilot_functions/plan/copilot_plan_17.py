# Based on the content of the markdown file, it appears that you are working on a smart home project and you need a new Python file named `function.py` to be created in the 'functions' folder. This file should contain the main function for your project.
#
# The functional description provided in the markdown file is in Chinese, but it seems to be related to different plans for the smart home system, such as a morning plan, a leave home plan, and a movie plan. The specific devices or actions associated with these plans are not clear due to the language barrier.
#
# The source code provided includes Python scripts for different components of the smart home system, such as sensors (`sensor.py`), actuators (`actuator.py`), and the overall home plan (`home_plan.py`). The `config.py` file contains various configuration settings for the system.
#
# Without more specific instructions or questions, it's hard to provide a more detailed answer. If you have a specific question or need help with a specific part of your project, please provide more details.
