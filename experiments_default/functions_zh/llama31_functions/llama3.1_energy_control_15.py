# This is a Python code that appears to be part of a home automation system. Here's a breakdown of the code:
# 
# **Importing Modules**
# 
# The code starts by importing various modules from a file called `logger_config.py`, which is not shown in this code snippet. These modules are likely related to logging and configuration.
# 
# **Defining Classes and Functions**
# 
# The code defines several classes and functions, including:
# 
# *   **Room**: A class that represents a room in the home automation system.
#     *   The class has attributes `name`, `sensors`, and `actuators`.
#     *   It provides methods to add sensors and actuators to a room.
#     *   The `print_info` method prints information about a room, including its name, sensors, and actuators.
# *   **create_room_with_components**: A function that creates a room with specified types of sensors and actuators.
# *   **home_plan**: A function that generates a home plan by creating multiple rooms with different components (sensors and actuators).
# *   **print_home_plan**: A function that prints the generated home plan.
# *   **get_room**, **get_room_sensors**, **get_room_actuators**: Functions that retrieve information about a specific room or its sensors/actuators.
# *   **get_all_sensors** and **get_all_actuators**: Functions that retrieve all instances of a specific type of sensor or actuator across multiple rooms.
# 
# **config.py**
# 
# The code also includes a separate file called `config.py` that contains configuration settings for the system, such as threshold values for temperature, humidity, light intensity, and daily routine duration.
# 
# **Main Program**
# 
# The main program (if executed directly) demonstrates the usage of these functions by generating a home plan, retrieving information about specific rooms or components, and printing the generated home plan.
# 
# Overall, this code appears to be part of a larger system that automates various aspects of a home's management. It provides functionality for creating a home plan with multiple rooms, adding sensors and actuators to each room, and retrieving information about these components across different rooms.
# 
# However, without more context or additional files (like `logger_config.py`), it is difficult to provide a precise explanation of the system's purpose, architecture, or potential applications.
