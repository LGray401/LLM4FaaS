        "content": "To implement the smart home application based on your functional description and layout, we can create a simple Python script that simulates the control of various smart devices in your smart home. Let's break down the required functionality for each plan:\n\n1. **MORNING PLAN**: Play music.\n2. **LEAVE HOME PLAN**: Turn off sockets.\n3. **MOVIE PLAN**: Open curtains.\n\nHere is a Python script that simulates this functionality:\n\n```python\nclass SmartHome:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize the state of devices\n        self.devices = {\n            \"Living Room\": {\n                \"Music Player\": False,\n                \"Sockets\": [True, True],  # Assume sockets are ON initially\n                \"Curtains\": [False, False]  # Assume curtains are closed initially\n            },\n            \"Bedroom\": {\n                \"Music Player\": False,\n                \"Sockets\": [True, True],  # Assume sockets are ON initially\n                \"Curtains\": [False]  # Assume curtain is closed initially\n            }\n        }\n\n    def morning_plan(self):\n        # Play music in living room and bedroom\n        self.devices[\"Living Room\"][\"Music Player\"] = True\n        self.devices[\"Bedroom\"][\"Music Player\"] = True\n        print(\"Morning Plan: Playing music in living room and bedroom.\")\n\n    def leave_home_plan(self):\n        # Turn off all sockets\n        for room in self.devices:\n            self.devices[room][\"Sockets\"] = [False] * len(self.devices[room][\"Sockets\"])\n        print(\"Leave Home Plan: All sockets are turned off.\")\n\n    def movie_plan(self):\n        # Open curtains in living room and bedroom\n        self.devices[\"Living Room\"][\"Curtains\"] = [True, True]\n        self.devices[\"Bedroom\"][\"Curtains\"] = [True]\n        print(\"Movie Plan: Curtains in living room and bedroom are opened.\")\n\n    def execute_plan(self, plan_name):\n        if plan_name == \"morning\":\n            self.morning_plan()\n        elif plan_name == \"leave_home\":\n            self.leave_home_plan()\n        elif plan_name == \"movie\":\n            self.movie_plan()\n        else:\n            print(\"Unknown plan. Please choose between 'morning', 'leave_home', or 'movie'.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python smart_home.py <plan_name>\")\n    else:\n        plan_name = sys.argv[1].lower()\n        smart_home = SmartHome()\n        smart_home.execute_plan(plan_name)\n```\n\nTo run the smart home application, you can use the following command in your Linux terminal:\n\n```bash\npython smart_home.py <plan_name>\n```\n\nReplace `<plan_name>` with one of the following options:\n- `morning` for the MORNING PLAN\n- `leave_home` for the LEAVE HOME PLAN\n- `movie` for the MOVIE PLAN\n\nFor example, to execute the morning plan, you would run:\n\n```bash\npython smart_home.py morning\n```\n\nThis command will simulate the actions described in the functional description using print statements to indicate what actions have been taken.",
