        "content": "To create a smart home application based on your requirements, we'll develop a Python script that schedules tasks according to the functional description you provided. We'll use the `schedule` library to manage the timing of these tasks. \n\nFirst, ensure you have Python installed on your Linux system. You'll also need to install the `schedule` library, which can be done with `pip`.\n\nHere's the Python script implementing your smart home automation:\n\n```python\nimport schedule\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef morning_plan():\n    print(\"7:40 - Starting the coffee machine.\")\n\ndef leave_home_plan():\n    print(\"8:00 - Closing the entrance door.\")\n\ndef movie_plan():\n    print(\"19:00 - Starting the TV.\")\n\ndef run_pending_tasks():\n    while True:\n        schedule.run_pending()\n        time.sleep(1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Schedule tasks based on your functional description\n    schedule.every().day.at(\"07:40\").do(morning_plan)\n    schedule.every().day.at(\"08:00\").do(leave_home_plan)\n    schedule.every().day.at(\"19:00\").do(movie_plan)\n\n    print(\"Smart home automation is running...\")\n    run_pending_tasks()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Instructions to Run the Script\n\n1. **Install Python and pip** (if not already installed):\n   - Open your terminal and type:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip\n     ```\n\n2. **Install the schedule library**:\n   - In the terminal, type:\n     ```bash\n     pip3 install schedule\n     ```\n\n3. **Save the Python script**: \n   - Save the above script to a file named `smart_home.py`.\n\n4. **Run the script**:\n   - In the terminal, navigate to the directory where `smart_home.py` is saved and type:\n     ```bash\n     python3 smart_home.py\n     ```\n\nThis setup will print messages to the terminal at the specified times, simulating the actions of your smart home devices. For a real-world application, the print statements would be replaced with actual API calls to your smart home devices.",
