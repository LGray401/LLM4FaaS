        "content": "To create a smart home application that can be run in a Linux terminal, we'll need to simulate the interaction with the smart devices based on the given functional description and layout. We'll write a simple Python script that allows you to execute different plans: \"MORNING PLAN\", \"LEAVE HOME PLAN\", and \"MOVIE PLAN\". \n\nHere is a Python script that implements the required functionality:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nclass SmartHome:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize the states of devices in each room\n        self.living_room = {\n            'curtains': 'closed',\n            'lights': 'on',\n            'windows': 'closed',\n            'tv': 'off'\n        }\n\n        self.bedroom = {\n            'curtains': 'closed',\n            'lights': 'on',\n            'windows': 'closed'\n        }\n\n        self.bathroom = {\n            'lights': 'on',\n            'windows': 'closed'\n        }\n\n        self.kitchen = {\n            'lights': 'on',\n            'windows': 'closed'\n        }\n\n    def morning_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing MORNING PLAN...\")\n        self.living_room['curtains'] = 'open'\n        self.bedroom['curtains'] = 'open'\n        print(\"Curtains in living room and bedroom have been opened.\")\n\n    def leave_home_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing LEAVE HOME PLAN...\")\n        # Turn off all lights\n        self.living_room['lights'] = 'off'\n        self.bedroom['lights'] = 'off'\n        self.bathroom['lights'] = 'off'\n        self.kitchen['lights'] = 'off'\n        # Close all windows\n        self.living_room['windows'] = 'closed'\n        self.bedroom['windows'] = 'closed'\n        self.bathroom['windows'] = 'closed'\n        self.kitchen['windows'] = 'closed'\n        print(\"All lights have been turned off and all windows have been closed.\")\n\n    def movie_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing MOVIE PLAN...\")\n        self.living_room['tv'] = 'on'\n        print(\"TV in the living room has been turned on.\")\n\n    def execute_plan(self, plan_name):\n        if plan_name == 'MORNING PLAN':\n            self.morning_plan()\n        elif plan_name == 'LEAVE HOME PLAN':\n            self.leave_home_plan()\n        elif plan_name == 'MOVIE PLAN':\n            self.movie_plan()\n        else:\n            print(f\"Unknown plan: {plan_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python3 smart_home.py <PLAN_NAME>\")\n        print(\"Available plans: MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, MOVIE PLAN\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    plan_name = sys.argv[1]\n    home = SmartHome()\n    home.execute_plan(plan_name)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- This script defines a `SmartHome` class that manages the state of various devices according to the smart home layout and functional description.\n- There are methods for each plan: `morning_plan`, `leave_home_plan`, and `movie_plan`, which adjust the states of devices accordingly.\n- The script takes a command-line argument to specify which plan to execute.\n\n### Running the Application:\n1. Save the script to a file, for example `smart_home.py`.\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x smart_home.py`.\n3. Run the script with a plan name as an argument:\n   - For the morning plan: `./smart_home.py \"MORNING PLAN\"`\n   - For the leave home plan: `./smart_home.py \"LEAVE HOME PLAN\"`\n   - For the movie plan: `./smart_home.py \"MOVIE PLAN\"`\n\nThis script simulates the execution of plans by printing the actions taken, such as opening curtains or turning off lights. Adjust the logic within the methods if you have more complex requirements or additional functionality.",
