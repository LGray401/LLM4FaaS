        "content": "To create a smart home application based on your functional description and layout, we'll develop a simple command-line Python script. This script will simulate the activation of devices based on voice commands for different plans: MORNING PLAN, LEAVE HOME PLAN, and MOVIE PLAN. We'll use a basic dictionary to map the commands to their corresponding actions within the smart home system.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef morning_plan():\n    # Turn on all lights in the Living Room\n    print(\"Turning on all lights in the Living Room.\")\n\ndef leave_home_plan():\n    # Open the curtains in the Living Room\n    print(\"Opening the curtains in the Living Room.\")\n\ndef movie_plan():\n    # Turn on the TV in the Living Room\n    print(\"Turning on the TV in the Living Room.\")\n\ndef execute_command(command):\n    if command == \"小雨 请开灯\":\n        morning_plan()\n    elif command == \"小雨 请打开窗帘\":\n        leave_home_plan()\n    elif command == \"小雨 请打开电视机\":\n        movie_plan()\n    else:\n        print(\"Unknown command.\")\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n        print(\"Please provide a command.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    command = sys.argv[1]\n    execute_command(command)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Application\n\n1. Save the above script to a file named `smart_home.py`.\n\n2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `smart_home.py` is located.\n\n3. You can run the application with the following command, passing the desired command as an argument:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 smart_home.py \"小雨 请开灯\"\n   ```\n\n   Replace `\"小雨 请开灯\"` with any of the other commands to see the corresponding actions:\n\n   - `\"小雨 请开灯\"` for the MORNING PLAN\n   - `\"小雨 请打开窗帘\"` for the LEAVE HOME PLAN\n   - `\"小雨 请打开电视机\"` for the MOVIE PLAN\n\nThis simple script simulates the functionality you described. In a real-world application, each function would interface with the actual smart home devices, likely through a home automation platform or API.",
