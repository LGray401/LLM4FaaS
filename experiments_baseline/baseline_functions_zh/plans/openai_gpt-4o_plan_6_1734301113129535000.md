        "content": "To create a Python application that implements the smart home functionality based on your description, we will define a simple command-line interface. This application will simulate the three plans: \"Morning Plan,\" \"Leave Home Plan,\" and \"Movie Plan\" by activating or deactivating certain smart devices in the specified rooms.\n\nLet's outline what each plan will do:\n\n1. **Morning Plan (起床)**:\n    - Turn on bedroom lights.\n    - Open bedroom curtains.\n    - Start the coffee machine in the kitchen.\n    - Notify the user through the living room notification sender.\n\n2. **Leave Home Plan (上班了)**:\n    - Turn off all lights.\n    - Close all curtains and windows.\n    - Turn off all electronic devices (like TV, music player, etc.).\n    - Lock all doors.\n\n3. **Movie Plan (观影模式)**:\n    - Dim the living room lights.\n    - Close living room curtains.\n    - Turn on the TV.\n    - Turn on the living room music player at a low volume.\n\nHere's the Python script to implement this:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\ndef morning_plan():\n    print(\"Executing Morning Plan...\")\n    print(\"Turning on bedroom lights...\")\n    print(\"Opening bedroom curtains...\")\n    print(\"Starting coffee machine in the kitchen...\")\n    print(\"Sending notification...\")\n\ndef leave_home_plan():\n    print(\"Executing Leave Home Plan...\")\n    print(\"Turning off all lights...\")\n    print(\"Closing all curtains and windows...\")\n    print(\"Turning off all electronic devices...\")\n    print(\"Locking all doors...\")\n\ndef movie_plan():\n    print(\"Executing Movie Plan...\")\n    print(\"Dimming living room lights...\")\n    print(\"Closing living room curtains...\")\n    print(\"Turning on the TV...\")\n    print(\"Turning on the living room music player at low volume...\")\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python smart_home.py <plan>\")\n        print(\"Available plans: morning, leave_home, movie\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    plan = sys.argv[1].lower()\n    \n    if plan == \"morning\":\n        morning_plan()\n    elif plan == \"leave_home\":\n        leave_home_plan()\n    elif plan == \"movie\":\n        movie_plan()\n    else:\n        print(\"Unknown plan. Available plans: morning, leave_home, movie\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Instructions to Run the Application\n\n1. Save the above script to a file named `smart_home.py`.\n2. Make the file executable and run it using the terminal:\n   \n   ```bash\n   chmod +x smart_home.py\n   ```\n\n3. Execute the script with one of the plans as an argument:\n\n   - For Morning Plan: \n     ```bash\n     ./smart_home.py morning\n     ```\n\n   - For Leave Home Plan:\n     ```bash\n     ./smart_home.py leave_home\n     ```\n\n   - For Movie Plan:\n     ```bash\n     ./smart_home.py movie\n     ```\n\nThis example is a basic simulation, and in a real-world scenario, you would replace the print statements with actual commands to control your smart devices.",
