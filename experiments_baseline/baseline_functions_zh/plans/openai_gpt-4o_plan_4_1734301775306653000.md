        "content": "To create a Python-based smart home application that corresponds to your functional description and layout, we need to develop a program that can:\n\n1. Open or close curtains in the morning.\n2. Turn off lights when leaving home.\n3. Adjust light brightness for movie time.\n\nBelow is a simple implementation using Python. This script assumes you have a command-line interface to interact with the smart devices.\n\n```python\nclass SmartHome:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.devices = {\n            \"living_room\": {\n                \"curtains\": [\"Curtain\"],\n                \"lights\": [\"Light\", \"Light\"]\n            },\n            \"bedroom\": {\n                \"curtains\": [\"Curtain\"],\n                \"lights\": [\"Light\", \"Light\"]\n            },\n            \"bathroom\": {\n                \"lights\": [\"Light\"]\n            },\n            \"kitchen\": {\n                \"lights\": [\"Light\"]\n            }\n        }\n\n    def morning_plan(self):\n        # Open curtains in both living room and bedroom\n        for room in [\"living_room\", \"bedroom\"]:\n            for curtain in self.devices[room][\"curtains\"]:\n                print(f\"Opening {room} {curtain}\")\n\n    def leave_home_plan(self):\n        # Turn off all lights\n        for room in self.devices:\n            for light in self.devices[room].get(\"lights\", []):\n                print(f\"Turning off {room} {light}\")\n\n    def movie_plan(self):\n        # Adjust light brightness\n        for room in [\"living_room\", \"bedroom\"]:\n            for light in self.devices[room][\"lights\"]:\n                print(f\"Dimming {room} {light} to movie brightness\")\n\n    def execute_plan(self, plan_name):\n        if plan_name == \"morning\":\n            self.morning_plan()\n        elif plan_name == \"leave_home\":\n            self.leave_home_plan()\n        elif plan_name == \"movie\":\n            self.movie_plan()\n        else:\n            print(\"Unknown plan\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python smart_home.py <plan_name>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    plan_name = sys.argv[1]\n    smart_home = SmartHome()\n    smart_home.execute_plan(plan_name)\n```\n\n### How to Run the Application\n\n1. Ensure you have Python installed on your Linux system.\n2. Save the code above in a file named `smart_home.py`.\n3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `smart_home.py` is stored.\n4. Run the application using the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python smart_home.py <plan_name>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<plan_name>` with one of the following options depending on the scenario you want to execute:\n   - `morning` for the Morning Plan\n   - `leave_home` for the Leave Home Plan\n   - `movie` for the Movie Plan\n\nFor example, to execute the Morning Plan, you would run:\n\n```bash\npython smart_home.py morning\n```\n\nThis script is a basic demonstration and assumes a simple print operation as a placeholder for actual device control commands. In a real-world application, you would replace the print statements with API calls or commands that interact with your smart home devices.",
