        "content": "To create a smart home application based on your functional description and layout, we can implement a simple command-line application in Python. This application will simulate the interaction with smart devices based on the given plans. Let's outline the specific actions for each plan and then provide the Python code.\n\n### Functional Plans\n\n1. **Morning Plan**: \n   - Trigger: \"小g 我要起床了\"\n   - Actions:\n     - Open curtains in the Bedroom.\n     - Turn on the Bedroom lights.\n     - Play morning music in the Bedroom.\n     - Start the coffee machine in the Kitchen.\n\n2. **Leave Home Plan**:\n   - Trigger: \"小g 我要走了 拜拜\"\n   - Actions:\n     - Turn off all lights.\n     - Close all windows.\n     - Lock all doors.\n     - Turn off all music players.\n     - Set the cleaning robots in the Living Room and Bedroom to start cleaning.\n     - Send a notification that the home is secured.\n\n3. **Movie Plan**:\n   - Trigger: \"小g 我想开心一下\"\n   - Actions:\n     - Dim the lights in the Living Room.\n     - Close the curtains in the Living Room.\n     - Turn on the TV and set it to movie mode.\n     - Play ambient music in the Living Room.\n\n### Python Application\n\nHere's a basic Python script that simulates these functionalities:\n\n```python\nclass SmartHome:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.rooms = {\n            \"Living Room\": [\"Light\", \"Window\", \"Curtain\", \"Music Player\", \"TV\"],\n            \"Bedroom\": [\"Light\", \"Curtain\", \"Music Player\"],\n            \"Kitchen\": [\"Coffee Machine\"],\n            \"Bathroom\": [],\n            \"Balcony\": []\n        }\n\n    def morning_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Morning Plan...\")\n        print(\"Opening Bedroom Curtains...\")\n        print(\"Turning on Bedroom Lights...\")\n        print(\"Playing Morning Music in Bedroom...\")\n        print(\"Starting Coffee Machine in Kitchen...\")\n\n    def leave_home_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Leave Home Plan...\")\n        print(\"Turning off all Lights...\")\n        print(\"Closing all Windows...\")\n        print(\"Locking all Doors...\")\n        print(\"Turning off all Music Players...\")\n        print(\"Starting Cleaning Robots in Living Room and Bedroom...\")\n        print(\"Sending Notification: Home Secured.\")\n\n    def movie_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Movie Plan...\")\n        print(\"Dimming Lights in Living Room...\")\n        print(\"Closing Curtains in Living Room...\")\n        print(\"Turning on TV to Movie Mode...\")\n        print(\"Playing Ambient Music in Living Room...\")\n\n    def execute_command(self, command):\n        if command == \"小g 我要起床了\":\n            self.morning_plan()\n        elif command == \"小g 我要走了 拜拜\":\n            self.leave_home_plan()\n        elif command == \"小g 我想开心一下\":\n            self.movie_plan()\n        else:\n            print(\"Unknown command!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    smart_home = SmartHome()\n    command = input(\"Enter your command: \")\n    smart_home.execute_command(command)\n```\n\n### Running the Application\n\nTo run this application in a Linux terminal, you can save the script to a file (e.g., `smart_home.py`) and then execute it using Python. Here's the command:\n\n```sh\npython3 smart_home.py\n```\n\nThis will prompt you to enter a command. Based on your input, it will execute the corresponding plan and simulate the smart home actions.",
