        "content": "To create a smart home application based on the provided functional description and smart home layout, we'll develop a Python script that simulates the operation of smart devices according to predefined plans. The application will be able to perform actions for the \"Morning Plan,\" \"Leave Home Plan,\" and \"Movie Plan.\"\n\nHere's the Python script for the smart home application:\n\n```python\nclass SmartHome:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize the devices with their respective states\n        self.devices = {\n            \"living_room\": {\n                \"light\": False,\n                \"curtain\": False,\n                \"coffee_machine\": False,\n            },\n            \"bedroom\": {\n                \"curtain\": False,\n            },\n            \"kitchen\": {\n                \"coffee_machine\": False,\n            }\n        }\n\n    def morning_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Morning Plan...\")\n        # Turn on the coffee machine in the kitchen\n        self.devices[\"kitchen\"][\"coffee_machine\"] = True\n        print(\"Coffee machine in the kitchen is ON.\")\n\n    def leave_home_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Leave Home Plan...\")\n        # Turn off all lights in the living room\n        self.devices[\"living_room\"][\"light\"] = False\n        print(\"All lights in the living room are OFF.\")\n\n    def movie_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Movie Plan...\")\n        # Close the curtains in the bedroom\n        self.devices[\"bedroom\"][\"curtain\"] = True\n        print(\"Curtains in the bedroom are CLOSED.\")\n\n    def run_plan(self, plan_name):\n        if plan_name.lower() == \"morning\":\n            self.morning_plan()\n        elif plan_name.lower() == \"leave_home\":\n            self.leave_home_plan()\n        elif plan_name.lower() == \"movie\":\n            self.movie_plan()\n        else:\n            print(f\"Unknown plan: {plan_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python smart_home.py <plan_name>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    plan_name = sys.argv[1]\n    smart_home = SmartHome()\n    smart_home.run_plan(plan_name)\n```\n\n### Instructions to Run\n\n1. **Save the script** to a file named `smart_home.py`.\n\n2. **Open a terminal** on your Linux system.\n\n3. **Navigate** to the directory where `smart_home.py` is saved.\n\n4. **Run the script** using one of the following commands, depending on the plan you want to execute:\n\n   - For the Morning Plan:\n     ```bash\n     python smart_home.py morning\n     ```\n\n   - For the Leave Home Plan:\n     ```bash\n     python smart_home.py leave_home\n     ```\n\n   - For the Movie Plan:\n     ```bash\n     python smart_home.py movie\n     ```\n\nThis script provides a basic structure to simulate a smart home system according to your functional description and layout. You can expand this script by adding more complex interactions and states as needed.",
