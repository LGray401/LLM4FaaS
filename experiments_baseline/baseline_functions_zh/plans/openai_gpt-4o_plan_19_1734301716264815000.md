        "content": "To create a smart home application based on your functional description and smart home layout, we can write a simple Python script. This script will simulate the automation of your smart home devices according to the specified plans. Here's how we can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nclass SmartHome:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.devices = {\n            \"Living Room\": [\"Curtain\", \"Socket\", \"Door\"],\n            \"Kitchen\": [\"Coffee Machine\"],\n            \"Bedroom\": [],\n            \"Bathroom\": [],\n            \"Balcony\": []\n        }\n\n    def morning_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Morning Plan...\")\n        # Open curtains and make coffee at 7:30\n        print(\"7:30 AM: Opening curtains in the Living Room.\")\n        print(\"7:30 AM: Brewing a cup of coffee in the Kitchen.\")\n        self.control_device(\"Living Room\", \"Curtain\", \"open\")\n        self.control_device(\"Kitchen\", \"Coffee Machine\", \"on\")\n\n    def leave_home_plan(self):\n        print(\"Executing Leave Home Plan...\")\n        # Lock the door and turn off all the sockets\n        print(\"Locking doors and turning off all sockets.\")\n        self.control_device(\"Living Room\", \"Door\", \"lock\")\n        self.control_device(\"Living Room\", \"Socket\", \"off\")\n        self.control_device(\"Kitchen\", \"Socket\", \"off\")\n        self.control_device(\"Bedroom\", \"Socket\", \"off\")\n        self.control_device(\"Bathroom\", \"Socket\", \"off\")\n\n    def control_device(self, room, device, action):\n        if device in self.devices[room]:\n            print(f\"{action.capitalize()}ing {device} in {room}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{device} not found in {room}.\")\n\n    def execute_plan(self, plan_name):\n        if plan_name.lower() == \"morning\":\n            self.morning_plan()\n        elif plan_name.lower() == \"leave home\":\n            self.leave_home_plan()\n        else:\n            print(\"Unknown plan.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    home = SmartHome()\n    # Execute the Morning Plan\n    home.execute_plan(\"morning\")\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate time passing\n    # Execute the Leave Home Plan\n    home.execute_plan(\"leave home\")\n```\n\n### How to Run the Script\n\n1. Save the script to a file, say `smart_home.py`.\n2. Ensure you have Python installed on your Linux system.\n3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `smart_home.py` is located.\n4. Run the script with the following command:\n\n```bash\npython3 smart_home.py\n```\n\nThis script will simulate the following:\n\n- The **Morning Plan** will open the curtains in the living room and brew coffee in the kitchen at 7:30 AM.\n- The **Leave Home Plan** will lock the doors and turn off all sockets when you leave.\n\nThe **Movie Plan** wasn't defined in your functional description, so it hasn't been implemented. If you provide details for it, such as dimming the lights or turning on the TV, we can add it to the script.",
