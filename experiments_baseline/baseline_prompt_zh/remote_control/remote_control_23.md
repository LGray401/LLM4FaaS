# Preparation
Hi, I want you to provide a smart home application in Python based on my given functional description, in conjunction with my smart home layout.

The required application should be able to be run in a linux terminal with one command. Provide me the command as well.

I will first give you the functional description, then show you the smart home layout.


# Functional Description
建立一个网络控制系统，大系统分支出五个小系统（每个屋子一个分支系统）。每个分支系统再分为两支小系统，（传感器系统和智能设备系统），再在传感器设并列分支，温度，湿度，光强度。同理再在智能设置并列分支。
