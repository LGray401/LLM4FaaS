<!-- Preparation -->
 Hi~ I would like to get a function code from you based on my current project setup. The project is based on smart home scenario.
 Here are the three necessary code files and I will provide the function description to you in the next message.

[//]: # (attached files: sensor.py, actuator.py, home-plan.py)

<!-- prompt 2-->
I need a function that I can control a device or several devices at home remotely by specifying what device is in which room.

<!-- result -->
1. need to import home_plan() in main function
2. the control function works almost perfect, can find room and device in that room and turn on/off works not just switching states.
3. ❎ :
   1. for light, we have additional mode to set brightness level, but the light needs to be turned on first, which is not implemented in the control function. 
   2. set_brightness() function is an example for setting brightness to medium 
   3. do not support other additional function except setting brightness
