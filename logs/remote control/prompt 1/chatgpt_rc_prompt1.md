<!-- Preparation -->
1. Hi~ I would like to get a function code from you based on my current project setup. I will first provide you the necessary code files and then describe the function I need to you. The project is based on smart home scenario.
2. I will give you three python files: sensor.py, actuator.py and home-plan.py, which shows the distribution of sensors and actuators at home 
3. provide 3 python files
4. here is the function description:



<!-- prompt 1-->
1.	I need a function that I can control a device or several devices at home remotely by specifying what device is in which room. for the devices have additional mode, please provide the matching feature to control them as well.

<!-- result -->
1. chatgpt only gives function sketch.
2. chatgpt does not give all additional function impl
3. chatgpt gives an example of set_brightness for light
4. cannot control sensors.<- we only require 'device(s)' in the prompt
5. have sample main function

<!-- add requirements -->
3. the three provided python files are in the 'home' folder and the required function should be in the 'functions' folder. Can you provide an improved version code for me?
4. ask: give an example about how to set brightness level 

<!-- result 2 -->
1. import files and give invocation example.
2. without sample main function before ask for examples, but works ✅
