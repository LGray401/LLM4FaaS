I can help you with the function code based on your current `Door`, `CleaningRobot`, and `SmartTV` classes. 

Here's an example of a function that gets all the sensors for a given room:

```Python
def get_room_sensors(home, room_name):
    for room in home:
        if room.name == room_name:
            return room.sensors

    print(f"there is no Sensor found in {room_name}")
    logger.warning(f"there is no Sensor found in {room_name}")
    return None  # no room_name room
```

Similarly, you can create functions for getting all actuators for a given room or all sensors/actuators of a specific type:

```Python
def get_room_actuators(home, room_name):
    for room in home:
        if room.name == room_name:
            return room.actuators

    print(f"there is no Actuator found in {room_name}")
    logger.warning(f"there is no Actuator found in {room_name}")
    return None


def get_all_sensors(home, sensor_type):
    all_sensors = []
    for room in home:
        for sensor in room.sensors:
            if isinstance(sensor, sensor_type):
                all_sensors.append(sensor)

    return all_sensors


def get_all_actuators(home, actuator_type):
    all_actuators = []
    for room in home:
        for actuator in room.actuators:
            if isinstance(actuator, actuator_type):
                all_actuators.append(actuator)

    return all_actuators
```

These functions can be used to retrieve specific rooms, sensors, or actuators based on the current state of your smart home.
